This is a modification of gameplay that tries to keep pace with the updates in the original mission.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE: THIS CURRENT VERSION REQUIRES THE BAF ADDONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE BAF APACHE AND THE BAF SERVICING MODULES</b>
<br>
The mission has been changed to add a lot of features, and to help with focusing on the accomodation of:
1. Smaller player groups
2. A desire for more of a Combined Arms playstyle
3. A bit more 'life' in the map
4. A tougher default enemy
<br>
<b>Additions</b>
<br>
<b>Butts Board</b> - A TV monitor object has been added to the base that the Officer can interact with.
<br>Features:
<br>Request a CAS or AT UAV (flying in air, over base)
<br>Refuel the fuel cargo of the fuel truck
<br>Request a TOW launcher be added to the unarmed Humvee

<b>Butts Submenu on BTC Crate</b> - Some engineer specific functions at the BTC_Object_Create crate
<br>Features:
<br>Spawn an autonomous MG, GMG, or Praetor
<br>A 5 minute repair/rearm option for vehicles that don't support the BAF Servicing menu (RHS stuff)

<b>More FOB Options</b>
<br>Additional interactions have been added to the FOB flag. You can redeploy to another base, access the arsenal, or teleport home. Note: Teleport home has a cooldown of 10 minutes.

<b>Different Starting Vehicles</b>
<br>Some vehicles have been changed around, while others have been added.
<br>Added vehicles: Zodiac Boat, Submarine, RHS Marine boat, M1A2 SEP Tank, A-164 wipeout/A-10D Thunderbolt II
<br>A couple of of the transport vehicles have been changed.
<br>Boats are respawnable like the Chinook.

<b>All of the other changes I can remember:</b>
<br>Base has been moved to the Military area of Altis Airport. Since there are more vehicles, and planes that need a runway, the base has been moved.<br>
<br>A lightpoint script has been attached to some base objects. This is so that the area is well-lit at night<br>
<br>Large Trucks (HEMMT) can tow planes and helicopters: There are situations that a wreck is inaccessible because a helicopter would crash into surroundings. This lets a HEMMT move these vehicles around, or Taxi them.<br>
<br>More civilians will spawn in cities, to hopefully offset performance cost, one of their waypoints have been removed<br>
<br>Asking for reputation will display the numerical rep value as well. This is important because....<br>
<br><b>Triggers have been added that will fail the mission if the rep value is -500</b>. This is to prevent people from just going hog wild, and the consequences for low rep in original mission didn't seem severe enough.<br>
<br>The default faction is IRAN<br>
<br>Some modules have been added or changed: ACE pointing distance increased to 30m, ACE_hearing all but disabled.<br>
<br>Medical Center added to Base: This upgrades medical training of everyone, so that people can be medevaced to base for triage- essentially, regular soldiers can use bloodbags on each other to recover from a mission.
